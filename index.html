   <main><p>The <strong>Fortissimus</strong> is a defunct event in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength_athletics">strength athletics</a>. The name means "the mightiest" and was a multi-event challenge at the end of which the winner is crowned as the -Strongest Man on Earth-. It was set up to bring together the strongest competitors on the planet independent of the organisations to which they were signed- and also as a tribute to the nineteenth-century Canadian strongman <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Cyr" title="Louis Cyr">Louis Cyr</a>, which gave it many similarities to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Defi_Mark_Ten_International" title="Le Defi Mark Ten International">Le Defi Mark Ten International</a> which last took place in Canada in the early 1990s. After its first airing in 2008- the strength athletics magazine Milo described it as the ultimate strongman competition ever held. Despite a successful edition in 2009- a reported lack of a major sponsor for 2010 resulted in the competition being suspended- no future contests have been announced.</p></main>
